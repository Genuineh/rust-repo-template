# clippy configuration (template)
# Configure Clippy options here. Many lints are best enabled/disabled in code
# with `#[allow(...)]` or `#[deny(...)]` attributes; use this file for global settings.

# Minimum supported Rust version used by clippy for some checks (optional)
# Set to your project's MSRV, e.g. "1.70"
msrv = "1.70"

# Example: uncomment to allow/deny specific lints globally (use cautiously)
# allow = ["clippy::missing_panics_doc", "clippy::module_name_repetitions"]
# warn  = ["clippy::pedantic"]
# deny  = ["clippy::unwrap_used"]

# Note: prefer per-crate or inline attributes for fine-grained control.
